# AI-Powered Virtual Teaching Assistant: Accelerated MERN + AI Project Plan

Main Takeaway: Develop a fully functional Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA) in just 8–10 weeks by leveraging the MERN stack for the core application and integrating AI services (LLMs, speech recognition, and text-to-speech) for interactive teaching features.

## 1. Project Overview
An AI Virtual Teaching Assistant will:
- Host interactive lessons and quizzes
- Answer students’ questions in natural language
- Provide spoken explanations
- Track student progress and suggest resources

## 2. Core Technologies
- Frontend: React with Hooks and Context API
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js REST API
- Database: MongoDB (Atlas)
- Auth & Hosting: Firebase Auth or Auth0, and Vercel/Heroku
- AI Services: OpenAI (ChatGPT API) or Hugging Face Inference API; Google Speech-to-Text; Amazon Polly or Google Text-to-Speech

## 3. Development Milestones

| Week | Goals & Deliverables | Key Tasks |
|-----|-----------------------|-----------|
| 1 | Project setup & basic MERN boilerplate | Initialize React app & Express server; Configure MongoDB connection |
| 2 | User Authentication & Roles | Implement signup/login (JWT or Firebase Auth); Define “student” and “instructor” roles |
| 3 | Lesson Management | CRUD for lessons in backend; Lesson list and detail pages in React |
| 4 | AI Q&A Prototype | Integrate ChatGPT API endpoint; Build chat UI for Q&A |
| 5 | Speech Recognition & Synthesis | Add “Ask by voice” using Google Speech-to-Text; Text-to-speech via Amazon Polly |
| 6 | Quiz & Progress Tracking | Quiz creation and attempt endpoints; Store scores and progress in MongoDB |
| 7 | Resource Recommendation & Analytics Dashboard | Use LLM to suggest supplementary materials; Instructor dashboard for analytics |
| 8 | Polish, Testing, & Deployment | End-to-end testing (unit + integration); Deploy frontend and backend to production |
| 9–10 (Optional) | Extensions | Real-time interactions (WebSockets); Multi-language support |

## 4. AI Integration Details
- Chat Interface:
  - Frontend sends user queries to backend
  - Backend proxies to LLM (OpenAI chat completions)
  - Return formatted responses to React chat window
- Voice I/O:
  - Speech-to-Text: Capture microphone input, send audio blob to Google STT API, convert to text query
  - Text-to-Speech: Send AI response text to Polly/Google TTS, play audio stream in browser
- Personalization & Context:
  - Store conversation history per user in MongoDB
  - Pass recent messages as system context to maintain continuity
- Resource Recommender:
  - Prompt LLM with user’s area of struggle and lesson topics
  - Parse returned links or summaries into “Recommended Resources” list

## 5. Rapid Development Tips
- Scaffold with Create React App and Express generator
- Use Axios interceptors for auth headers
- Leverage Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for quick UI
- Employ serverless functions (Vercel/Lambda) to host AI endpoints securely
- Automate testing with Jest and React Testing Library

## 6. Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope
- Text Q&A chatbot
- Lesson listing & viewing
- Auth & user roles
- Progress tracking

Deliver MVP by Week 5, then iterate with voice features and analytics.
